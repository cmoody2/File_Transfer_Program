# File Transfer Program
A comapany branch needs to transfer new and/or modified
files to their home office each day and they need a script that can decide
which files are valid candidates for transfering. This program can decide whether not a file is new or modified within 24hrs 
and add it to a directory that will be sent to the home office each day. The GUI allows a user to initiate this process manually
but it can be refactored to do so automatically.

Technologies used in creation:
- Python
- Tkinter
